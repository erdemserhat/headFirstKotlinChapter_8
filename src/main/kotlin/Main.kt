     * when there is no suitable initial value for a property, or when you need to initialize it at a later time
     * for reasons such as dependency injection. For example, when defining a property within a class and you plan
     * to initialize it at a later time, you can declare the property with the lateinit keyword.
     * Here's an example:

    /**
     * When using lateinit, there are some important points to keep in mind:
     * 1. A lateinit property will be null from the moment the class is created, so you must initialize it before using it.
     * 2. If you try to access a lateinit property before it's initialized, it will throw an UninitializedPropertyAccessException exception.
     * 3. The lateinit keyword can only be used with variable (var) properties, and you must ensure that the property is initialized before attempting to access it.
     * In this way, in Kotlin, you can use lateinit to defer the initialization of properties within a class until a later point in time.

     * initialization tasks during the class's construction process.
